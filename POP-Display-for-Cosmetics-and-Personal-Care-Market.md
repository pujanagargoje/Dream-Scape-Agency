The increasing demand for beauty and personal care products across retail channels, including supermarkets, pharmacies, and specialty stores, is expected to drive the growth of point-of-purchase (POP) displays in this sector. These displays play a significant role in enhancing brand visibility and consumer engagement, thereby boosting in-store sales and influencing buying behavior.</p><p>As cosmetics and personal care products continue to gain popularity globally, the demand for innovative POP display solutions is likely to increase. Factors such as growing consumer spending on beauty products, rising awareness of skincare, and the expansion of retail chains are contributing to the demand for aesthetically appealing and functional POP displays.
